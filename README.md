- **Java 17**: Latest LTS Java version.
- **WebClient**: Non-blocking HTTP client for external API calls.
- **Caffeine Cache**: High-performance in-memory caching.
- **Maven**: Dependency management and build automation.

### Infrastructure
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Containerization for consistent development and production environments.
- **Nginx**: Production-grade reverse proxy and static file serving.
- **Railway**: Cloud deployment platform with private networking.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
- **SWAPI**: External Star Wars API data source.

## üö¶ Quick Start

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    - **Docker Desktop** (v20.0+)
    - **Git**
    - At least 4GB RAM available for containers.
    - Ports `6969` and `8080` must be free.

2.  **Clone and start the application:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/javierferpa/StarWarsWebApplication.git
    cd StarWarsWebApplication
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```
    > **Note:** The initial build may take 3-5 minutes while Maven and Node.js dependencies are downloaded and compiled.

3.  **Access the application:**
    - **üåê Frontend**: [http://localhost:6969](http://localhost:6969)
    - **üì° Backend API**: [http://localhost:8080/api/people](http://localhost:8080/api/people)

> üëâ **If something fails, please check the [Troubleshooting](#-troubleshooting) section.**

## üì° API Documentation

The API provides endpoints for `people` and `planets`.

### Query Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `page` | integer | 0 | Page number (zero-based) |
| `size` | integer | 15 | Items per page (max 100) |
| `search` | string | - | Case-insensitive partial name search |
| `sort` | string | name | Sort field: `name`, `created`, `height`, `population` |
| `dir` | string | asc | Sort direction: `asc`, `desc` |

### Example Request

```bash
# Get the second page of planets, sorted by population descending
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/planets?page=1&sort=population&dir=desc"
```

### Response Format

```json
{
  "content": [...],
  "page": {
    "size": 15,
    "number": 1,
    "totalElements": 60,
    "totalPages": 4
  }
}
```

## üèó Architecture & Performance

The application uses a **microservices architecture** with a decoupled frontend and backend.

### Key Design Principles
- **Backend**: Implements the **Strategy Pattern** for flexible sorting, ensuring the system is open for extension but closed for modification. A **Repository Pattern** abstracts data access, and non-blocking I/O is handled with **WebClient**.
- **Frontend**: Follows a **Smart/Dumb Component** architecture, uses **RxJS** for reactive state management, and lazy loads feature modules.

### Performance Optimizations
- **Backend**: High-performance **Caffeine Cache** reduces latency from the external SWAPI. Server-side pagination minimizes payload size.
- **Frontend**: **Lazy Loading** of routes, **OnPush Change Detection**, and `trackBy` functions ensure a smooth user experience.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Deployment

The application is deployed on **Railway**, leveraging its container platform for scalability and reliability.

- **Infrastructure**: The `starwars-frontend` (Nginx) and `starwars-backend` (Spring Boot) services run in separate containers.
- **Private Networking**: Services communicate over a secure private network, with the frontend proxying requests to the backend.
- **CI/CD**: A **GitHub Actions** workflow automates testing and deployment. Pushes to the `develop` branch trigger a deployment to the production environment on Railway. For more details, see the [`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`](.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml) file.

## üîß Development

### Local Development
For development with hot-reload:

- **Backend**: Navigate to `BackEnd/` and run `./mvnw spring-boot:run`.
- **Frontend**: Navigate to `frontend/` and run `npm install && npm start`.

### Testing
- **Backend**: `cd BackEnd && ./mvnw test` (30 tests)
- **Frontend**: `cd frontend && npm test` (7 tests)

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please fork the repository, create a feature branch, and submit a pull request. Ensure all tests pass and adhere to the existing code style.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Port Conflicts
If ports `6969` or `8080` are in use, stop the conflicting application or change the ports in `docker-compose.yml`.

### Build Issues
If you encounter build problems, try a clean rebuild:
```bash
docker-compose down --volumes --rmi all
docker-compose up -d --build --no-cache
```

### Log Analysis
To view logs for all services or a specific one:
```bash
# View all logs in real-time
docker-compose logs -f

# View logs for a specific service
docker-compose logs backend
docker-compose logs frontend
```
